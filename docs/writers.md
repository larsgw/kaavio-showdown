# Writers
Kaavio Showdown allows you to create interactive descriptions that accompany a Kaavio diagram. These descriptions 
contain interactive links that, when clicked, change the visualisation of the diagram. For example, you can highlight and zoom in on
diagram elements. A demo of the kind of descriptions you can achieve is available 
[here](https://jacobwindsor.github.io/jcbwndsr/interactive-descriptions.html).

## Standard Markdown syntax
Before starting you should be familiar with Markdown. It is a text-to-html conversion tool for the web that allows you 
to write in an easy-to-understand plain text format. This means you can easily create headings, lists, tables, inline images etc.

Learn the Markdown syntax [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Basic syntax
The syntax for all interactive description links is the same across operations. More information on the operations
you can perform is available further down below.

**Important**: Each link is *self describing*. This means that the diagram will be reset *before* performing the
operations you specify. 

```markdown
K[some text](operation(params))
```

This would render a link that looks like this: [some text]().

**Note**: Don't forget the `K` namespace!

### Multiple operations
You may add multiple operations in one link like so:
```markdown
K[some text](operation1(params) operation2(params))
```

## Operations
Each operation is written is a JavaScript like style. Those with development experience should be comfortable with this.
### toggleHighlight
```javascript
toggleHighlight(entity_id: string, color: string)
```
e.g.:
```javascript
toggleHighlight('abc', 'red')
```

### highlightOn
```javascript
highlightOn(entity_id: string, color: string)
```

### highlightOff
```javascript
highlightOff(entity_id: string)
```

### hide
```javascript
hide(entity_id: string)
```
  
### show
```javascript
show(entity_id: string)
```

### toggleHidden
```javascript
toggleHidden(entity_id: string)
```

### zoomOn
```javascript
zoomOn(entity_id(s): string | string[])
```

e.g.:
```javascript
zoomOn('abc')

// or
zoomOn(['abc', '123'])
```
  
### panTo
```javascript
panTo(entity_id(s): string | string[])
```

## Examples
The below example will create a link that highlights `node1` red, zoom onto `node2` and hide `node3`:

```markdown
K[do some stuff](highlightOn('node1', 'red') zoomOn('node2') hide('node3'))
```
